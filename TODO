* Script to automate
  *   Currently convert Juypter notebook -> (i)python. Should I rewrite as basic python
* Display - create a webpage to visualize
* Output more graphs
* Can I add other cities?
* Add to a Dashboard of my own - CV19 data, Air Quality monitoring, MT sensor data
  * What's a good way to pull this all together?
  * Juypter Voila ?
*  https://jupyter.org/
* Work out how to run Rt analysis
* Reproducible install / execution
  * via docker?
  * Use python virtualenv
* Upload to github
* Show data in github?
* Notebook should be able to take any JSON in correct format and generate parsed data as graphs
  ... i.e. shouldn't have "Alameda" in it, unless passed as a parameter; perhaps write graphs to subdirectories
